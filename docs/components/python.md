    # Entity extraction
    # Context building
    # Response generation
```

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. Text preprocessing and normalization
2. spaCy NLP analysis (tokenization, POS, NER)
3. Intent classification and command detection
4. Context integration and memory retrieval
5. Response generation and post-processing

### Core NLP Logic (`core_nlp_logic.py`)

**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Command recognition and classification
- Intent parsing from natural language
