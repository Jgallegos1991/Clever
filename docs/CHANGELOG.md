# Changelog (Deprecated Location)

This file's authoritative content has moved to the root `CHANGELOG.md`.

Do not add new entries here. All updates must go to `../CHANGELOG.md`.

Historical 2025-09-20 entries and Unreleased section were consolidated in the root file to eliminate duplication and reduce merge drift.

Rationale:

- Single source of truth eases release automation integration.
- Prevents divergent histories between documentation and repository root.

If tooling still references this path, it remains as a lightweight pointer. Consider removing once all scripts / CI reference only the root changelog.
