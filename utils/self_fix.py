"""Self-healing / auto-remediation utilities (experimental placeholder).

Why:
	Envisions a future mechanism for Clever to detect and remediate minor internal
	inconsistencies (e.g., stale file inventory, missing indexes, dangling temp data)
	without human intervention, while remaining strictly offline and transparent.
	A documented scaffold clarifies intent and prevents accidental undocumented logic
	being added later in a rush, preserving architectural discipline.
Where:
	Would be invoked by maintenance workflows (``automated_monitor.py``,
	``system_validator.py``) or an administrative route / CLI command to perform
	low-risk corrective actions after integrity checks.
How:
	Provides a ``plan_self_fixes()`` function returning a list of proposed fix
	operations (currently static). Actual mutation / execution would be implemented in
	a future ``apply_self_fixes()`` while ensuring each action is idempotent and
	logged via the evolution / debug subsystems.

Connects to:
	- system_validator.py: Source of detected issues feeding proposed fixes.
	- debug_config.py: Logging of attempted and completed self-heal steps.
	- evolution_engine.py: (Potential) telemetry of maintenance interventions.

	"""Return a static list of hypothetical self-fix plans.

	Why: Gives callers a predictable contract for early experimentation and UI wiring
	before dynamic detection logic is implemented.
	Where: Could be consumed by a future admin dashboard or CLI command to preview
	maintenance actions.
	How: Returns a hard-coded list; future logic may inspect file inventory, database
	health, or cache directoriesâ€”always staying within offline and single-DB rules.

	Returns:
		List of dictionaries each describing a potential remedial action.

	Connects to:
		- system_validator.py: Will supply real diagnostics for transformation.
		- database.py: Potential schema integrity verifications.
