"""
Core NLP logic and configuration management for Clever AI

Why: Provides essential configuration management and intent classification
functionality for Clever's startup process and natural language understanding
capabilities during user interactions.
Where: Used by app.py during startup for configuration management and by
persona.py for intent classification in user message processing.
How: Implements configuration upgrade/finalization functions and basic NLP
utilities for intent detection and entity extraction using pattern matching.

Connects to:
    - app.py: Called during startup for configuration management
    - persona.py: Provides intent classification for response generation
    - config.py: Manages configuration settings and validation
Core NLP logic and configuration management for the Clever assistant.
Handles configuration upgrades and finalization during app startup.
