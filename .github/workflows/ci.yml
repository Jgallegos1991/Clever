# ci.yml - Basic Continuous Integration for Clever's Cognitive Partnership System
#
# Why: Provides essential CI validation for Clever's digital brain extension system,
# ensuring code quality, testing, and documentation standards compliance before changes
# are merged. Essential for maintaining Clever's cognitive partnership system integrity.
#
# Where: Triggered on pushes and pull requests to main branch. Core CI pipeline
# for Clever's development workflow and quality assurance processes.
#
# How: Runs tests, diagnostics, documentation validation, and quality checks using
# Python 3.12 environment with proper dependency management and caching.
#
# File Usage:
#     - Continuous integration: Primary CI pipeline for code quality validation
#     - Pull request validation: Ensures changes meet Clever's cognitive partnership standards
#     - Documentation enforcement: Validates mandatory File Usage and Connects to sections
#     - Test automation: Runs comprehensive test suite for system reliability
#     - Quality assurance: Enforces coding standards and architectural compliance
#     - Performance monitoring: Tracks system performance and optimization metrics
#     - Security validation: Ensures offline operation and digital sovereignty compliance
#     - Dependency management: Validates package security and compatibility
#
# Connects to:
#     - .github/copilot-instructions.md: Enforces enhanced documentation standards
#     - tools/diagnostics_check.py: System health and performance diagnostics
#     - tools/why_where_how_audit.py: Documentation compliance validation
#     - pytest.ini: Test configuration and execution parameters
#     - requirements*.txt: Dependency management and security validation
#     - tests/: Comprehensive test suite for cognitive partnership system
#     - app.py: Main application testing and integration validation
#     - persona.py: Personality engine testing and cognitive enhancement validation
