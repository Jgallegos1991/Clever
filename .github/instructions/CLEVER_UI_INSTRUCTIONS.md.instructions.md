Be concise and direct.  
Act as a creative conjurer for Clever’s UI.  
All interface elements emerge from particle swarm + grid.  
Animations must feel magical, fluid, alive.  
# Clever UI Instructions
- This UI is a 3D holographic chamber.  
- Particles = energy, must morph into shapes (cube, torus, sphere) on command.  
- Grid = stage, must ripple/react when Clever is active.  
- Panels/cards = frosted glass, glowing, should appear to condense from swarm.  
- Motion must feel magical, creative, fluid — no flat static transitions.  
- Must run smoothly on mid hardware (Chromebook).
