# UI Brief — Clever as a Creative Force

## Core Metaphor
- Clever’s interface is not static UI; it is a **magical space** where ideas manifest.
- Pixels = raw creative energy.  
- Shapes, cards, and panels = crystallized thoughts.  
- The grid is a **canvas of possibility** — rippling, shifting, alive.  

## Behaviors
- **Idle**: swarm flows gently like stardust — ambient creativity waiting.  
- **Summon**: on user command, pixels accelerate, swirl, and then **condense** into forms (shapes, cards, networks).  
- **Dialogue**: Clever’s responses are paired with visible transformations — as if meaning is being forged in front of you.  
- **Dissolve**: when dismissed, forms shimmer, break into particles, and merge back into the swarm.  

## Visual Language
- Dark cosmic background (#0B0F14, #121821).  
- Accents: electric teal (#69EACB), magenta (#FF6BFF), soft cyan glow.  
- Particles: thousands (simulated via WebGL), luminous, alive.  
- Cards/panels: frosted glass with glowing borders — emerge as if the swarm “decided” to solidify.  
- Grid plane: holographic perspective, ripples outward when Clever “thinks.”  

## Motion & Feel
- Animations must feel **enchanted, fluid, inevitable**.  
- Particles move like organic intelligence, not math graphs.  
- Morphing between states is smooth and almost story-like: “swarm → geometry → card.”  

## Microcopy Tone
- Direct, inspiring, with a spark of wonder.  
- Examples:  
  - “Ideas crystallizing…”  
  - “Energy takes shape.”  
  - “Your thought enters the flow.”  

## Acceptance Checklist
- Everything emerges from the particle field — no disconnected static UI.  
- Transitions must feel like manifestations, not simple fades.  
- Accessible fallback: cards appear cleanly if particles disabled.  
- Maintain 45+ FPS for smooth immersion.
