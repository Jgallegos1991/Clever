# 🚀 CLEVER AI - SETUP COMPLETE!

## 📱 **Phone Access Issue Fix**

The "network map response timeout" issue is because Tailscale isn't properly running in this container environment. Here's the fix:

### **Option 1: Get Your Auth Key & Fix Tailscale**
```bash
# 1. Get your Tailscale auth key
# Go to: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
# Sign in with: lapirfta@gmail.com  
# Create key with: Reusable=YES, Ephemeral=YES, Preauthorized=YES

# 2. Set the auth key and fix connection
export TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY='tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY-HERE'
make tailscale-fix

# 3. Your Clever will be accessible at:
# http://clever-ai-jay:5000 (from any device on your Tailscale)
```

### **Option 2: Port Forward (Quick Fix)**
```bash
# Forward port 5000 to your host machine
# Then access via your computer's local IP
# http://YOUR-COMPUTER-IP:5000
```
