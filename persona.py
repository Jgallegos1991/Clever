"""Persona Engine - Clever's Digital Brain Extension & Cognitive Partnership System.

This module implements the core personality and response generation for Clever AI.
For architecture context see: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/persona_spec.md` (if present), and README.

Why:
    Core personality + cognition orchestrator. Converts raw user text + remembered context
    + evolving preference signals into adaptive, authentic responses that feel like a
    lifelong friend while amplifying cognitive capability.

Where:
    Sits between Flask endpoints (`app.py`) and foundational subsystems (memory, NLP,
    evolution logging, file search). Provides a unified, docstring-rich surface that
    downstream tooling (introspection, diagnostics) can map into the reasoning graph.

How:
    1. Acquire fresh NLP analysis (keywords, sentiment, entities, noise metrics)
    2. Pull contextual memories + conversation history (if memory enabled)
    3. Optionally predict preferred response mode (Auto → specialized mode)
    4. Detect special intents (file search) and short‑circuit if needed
    5. Generate base response via chosen stylistic handler
    6. Ensure surface variation (anti-repetition) + subtle genius flavor injection
    7. Persist interaction (memory + evolution engine) and return structured `PersonaResponse`

ACTIVE COGNITION:
    (Planned / partial) Idle threads can grow a computation cache; persona references
    genuine background work instead of fabricated “thinking” claims.

DETAILED INTEGRATION MAP (Function‑Level Arrows):
    memory_engine.py
        * __init__  -> get_memory_engine(): obtain memory facade instance
        * generate() -> get_contextual_memory(): fetch semantically related past content
        * generate() -> get_conversation_history(): recent dialog for continuity
        * generate() -> predict_preferences(): mode prediction heuristics
        * generate() -> store_interaction(): persist new exchange
        * generate() -> MemoryContext: structured capsule of interaction metadata
    nlp_processor.py
        * generate() -> get_nlp_processor(): lazy-init NLP processor singleton/factory
        * generate() -> process_text(): unified analysis (keywords, sentiment, entities)
    evolution_engine.py
        * app.py /api/chat uses PersonaResponse → evolution_engine.log_interaction()
    app.py
        * chat() -> PersonaEngine.generate(): primary conversational route
        * api_ping() -> PersonaEngine: liveness/persona health probe
        * api_runtime_introspect() -> PersonaEngine: introspection overlay hooks
    database.py
        * Indirect persistence via memory_engine using single `clever.db` invariant
    user_config.py / config.py
        * Influence runtime personalization (e.g., user name, mode defaults)
    utils/file_search.py
        * _maybe_handle_file_search() -> search_by_extension(), search_files(): local FS intent

    These explicit arrows are parsed by introspection tooling to maintain a live
    reasoning graph. Keep them current when integration points evolve.

Summary Cognitive Flow:
    present understanding (NLP) + past experience (memory) + preference prediction
    → style/mode selection → contextual augmentation → response → learning/logging.
