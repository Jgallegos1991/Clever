"""
Persona Engine for Clever AI

Why:
    Converts raw user intent + localized analysis signals into tailored, empathetic
    replies across five adaptive modes (Auto, Creative, Deep Dive, Support, Quick Hit).
    It is the semantic forge where contextual arrows are created: each response embeds
    memory references, inferred mode, and reasoning layers—fuel for downstream logging
    and introspection.
Where:
    Invoked by `app.py` chat endpoints; draws from `memory_engine` for relevance,
    `nlp_processor` for linguistic and sentiment cues, and surfaces debug metrics the
    evolution and introspection systems can consume. Feeds database only indirectly
    via memory storage pathways.
How:
    Lazily initializes NLP + memory, predicts or confirms mode, synthesizes response via
    mode-specific style handlers, enforces anti-repetition variation, layers structured
    reasoning (especially for why/how queries), generates proactive suggestions, and
    emits a `PersonaResponse` annotated with debug metrics (arrows for observability).

Connects to:
    - memory_engine.py: Contextual memory retrieval & storage hooks
    - nlp_processor.py: Analysis pipeline (keywords, entities, sentiment)
    - evolution_engine.py: Interaction logging consumer of mode + telemetry
    - app.py: Primary caller routing user input to persona
    - database.py: Underlying persistence via memory interactions
    - introspection.py: Exposes persona_mode & metrics in runtime snapshot
