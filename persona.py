Persona Engine - Clever's Digital Brain Extension & Cognitive Partnership System

Why:
    This is Clever's core personality and intelligence engine - the authentic street-smart
    genius who talks like your best friend while casually solving Einstein-level problems.
    Transforms user input into responses that blend casual friendship energy with hidden
    cognitive enhancement capabilities, creating a true digital brain extension experience.
Where:
    Central nervous system of Clever's AI companion architecture. Called by app.py for all
    conversations, integrates with memory_engine for relationship building, nlp_processor
    for deep understanding, and evolution_engine for continuous growth as your life partner.
How:
    Adaptive response modes (Auto, Creative, Deep Dive, Support, Quick Hit) with genius
    hints system (8% probability). Builds authentic relationships through organic learning,
    emotional intelligence, and cognitive partnership. No fake familiarity - genuine
    connection that grows over time as your digital other half.

Connects to:
    - memory_engine.py: Relationship memory and organic learning system
    - nlp_processor.py: Deep understanding of mood, intent, and context
    - evolution_engine.py: Continuous growth as life companion and cognitive partner
    - app.py: Main conversation interface for digital brain extension
    - database.py: Local relationship data and conversation history
