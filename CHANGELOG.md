## [Unreleased]

### 2025-09-26: Enhanced Documentation Standards 
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Mandatory File Usage & Connects To Documentation** - Enhanced all documentation standards to require comprehensive "File Usage" and "Connects to" sections in every file:
  - Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with mandatory documentation enforcement rules
  - Enhanced `docs/config/device_specifications.md` with comprehensive system diagnostic information from September 26, 2025 system analysis
  - Updated `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `file-inventory.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `COPILOT_USAGE_GUIDE.md`, and `GITHUB_AGENT_GUIDE.md` with new standards
  - Added "File Usage" tracking for multi-usage documentation across all files
  - Implemented zero-tolerance documentation validation rules
  - Created systematic interconnection mapping for Clever's cognitive partnership system
  - Enhanced connection documentation for debugging efficiency and system intelligence

- (Add other upcoming changes here)

### Changed

- Documentation coverage raised to 100% (module-level Why/Where/How across all scanned Python files).
- Refined `tools/docstring_enforcer.py` to use relative path exclusion (eliminates false duplicate-path hits and preserves accurate coverage metrics).

### Added (Unreleased)

- **ðŸ§  MAJOR: Cognitive Shape Engine** - Revolutionary intelligent shape generation system (`cognitive_shape_engine.py`, 567 lines) connecting Clever's particle formation to her memory and cognitive systems. Fulfills original vision of shapes connected to her mind with:
  - **Memory Integration**: Learns aesthetic preferences and adapts future generations
  - **Emotional Intelligence**: Shape complexity/colors respond to user emotional state  
  - **Contextual Awareness**: Uses conversation history for cognitive enhancement
  - **Preference Learning**: Builds personalized aesthetic profiles over time
  - **Advanced Metadata**: Each shape includes cognitive enhancement markers, emotional resonance scores, complexity adaptation, and personalization levels
  - **Mathematical Sophistication**: Generates up to 195+ coordinates with fractal precision
  - Integration with `persona.py` for seamless cognitive-enhanced shape responses
- Placeholder tests `tests/test_util_placeholders.py` safeguarding return contracts for `summarize_repo.summarize()` and `self_fix.plan_self_fixes()`.
- Runtime introspection system: `introspection.py`, `/api/runtime_introspect` endpoint, and optional `?debug=1` overlay. Converts Why/Where/How docstring pattern into live navigational graph ("arrows between dots") showing recent template renders, endpoint reasoning metadata, persona mode, last error, and git hash for effortless debugging.
- Follow-up introspection enhancements: slow render flag (heuristic threshold), evolution interaction counters, drift warnings (missing Why/Where/How), accessible ARIA live region announcing AI messages, CLI snapshot tool (`tools/runtime_dump.py`).
- Reasoning coverage metrics exposed via `/api/runtime_introspect` (`reasoning_coverage` block: endpoints_total, endpoints_complete, percent) enabling quantitative tracking of documentation completeness.
- Pre-commit enforcement hook (`tools/verify_reasoning_docs.py` + `tools/install_hooks.sh`) blocking commits introducing Python functions/classes without Why/Where/How tokens (unless explicitly skipped) to prevent reasoning drift.
- Automated reasoning graph generator (`tools/generate_reasoning_graph.py`) producing `docs/reasoning_graph.md` adjacency map (nodes, edges, orphan detection) turning docstrings into auditable architecture artifact.
- Enhanced core docstrings (`app.py`, `evolution_engine.py`, `persona.py`) with "arrows between dots" narrative clarifying orchestration, temporal telemetry, and semantic layering responsibilities.
- Initial reasoning graph artifact (`docs/reasoning_graph.md`) â€“ updates recommended after significant feature merges (invoke generator script post-change).

### Security

- Identified one moderate dependency vulnerability via GitHub advisory (Dependabot alert #2) â€“ assessment pending; remediation path to be evaluated in next cycle.

## 2025-09-20

### Added

- Unified `clever-ci.yml` workflow: lint, tests, security (non-blocking), doc pattern scan, file inventory auto-commit.
- Advanced NLP reasoning & mode variation system in `persona.py`.
- Hybrid sentiment + readability + concept density pipeline in `nlp_processor.py`.
- Performance benchmarking harness (`tools/perf_benchmark.py`).
- Centralized flake8 config `.flake8`.

### Fixed

- Database `add_utterance` nested scope regression & lock usage consistency.
- Sentiment polarity attribute access guard in NLP layer.
- Port conflict resolution (stale Flask process) clarified in ops docs.

### Removed

- Redundant legacy GitHub workflows (documentation enforcement, coverage, performance monitor, dependency security duplicates, release notes, stale branch cleanup, inventory updater). Replaced by consolidated `clever-ci.yml`.
- Deprecated experimental template `templates/index_new.html` removed (superseded by primary `templates/index.html` with overlay + particle system integration).

### Moved / Consolidated

- Misnamed `changlog.md` contents merged here; `docs/CHANGELOG.md` marked deprecated.

### Notes

- Future enhancements: extend variation to non-Auto modes, richer long-term memory weighting, CI-integrated performance thresholding, offline guard negative tests.
