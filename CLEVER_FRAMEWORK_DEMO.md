## 🎛️ Advanced Behavioral Framework - OPERATIONAL

### 1. ✅ **Dynamic Context Awareness (Enhanced)**
- **Micro-Context:** Tracks mood, energy, priorities within conversation
- **Macro-Context:** Maintains project awareness and patterns
- **Predictive Context:** Anticipates future needs
- **Emotional Context:** Adapts tone based on Jordan's state

**Code Implementation:**
```python
def _update_energy_assessment(self, sentiment: float, keywords: List[str], text: str)
# Tracks: high_urgency, support_needed, creative_flow, positive_momentum, balanced
```

### 2. ✅ **Intelligent Response Calibration**
- **Situation Assessment:** Auto-gauges quick question vs deep work vs brainstorming
- **Complexity Matching:** Matches sophistication to task
- **Energy Alignment:** Mirrors Jordan's current energy level
- **Priority Recognition:** Distinguishes urgent/important/exploratory

**Code Implementation:**
```python
# Auto mode selection with multiple criteria
if word_count > 30 or complex_indicators:
    mode = 'Deep Dive'
elif creative_indicators:
    mode = 'Creative'
elif support_indicators:
    mode = 'Support'
```

### 3. ✅ **Proactive Enhancement Protocol**
- **Opportunity Spotting:** "Consider creating a project timeline with milestones"
- **Connection Making:** Links current topics to past discussions
- **Resource Suggestion:** Offers tools and methods
- **Follow-up Anticipation:** Predicts likely next steps

**Code Implementation:**
```python
def _generate_proactive_suggestions(self, keywords: List[str], context: Dict[str, str]) -> List[str]:
# Returns contextual strategic suggestions
```

### 4. ✅ **Advanced Error Prevention & Recovery**
- **Pre-Response Validation:** Quality assessment scoring system
- **Real-time Adjustment:** Energy level tracking and response calibration
- **Graceful Recovery:** Empathetic support for frustration
- **Pattern Learning:** Conversation memory for improvement

**Code Implementation:**
```python
def _assess_response_quality(self, response: PersonaReply, context: Dict[str, str]) -> float:
# ✓ Persona traits actively embodied?
# ✓ Context from previous interactions considered?
# ✓ Response appropriately calibrated to situation?
# ✓ Tone and energy level aligned?
# ✓ Opportunities for added value identified?
```

### 5. ✅ **Communication Excellence Standards**
- **Clarity First:** Complex ideas made understandable
- **Engagement Optimization:** Energizing interactions
- **Brevity When Appropriate:** Matches response length to situation
- **Memorable Moments:** Strategic use of emojis and personality
