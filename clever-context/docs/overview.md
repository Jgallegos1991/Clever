# System Overview

## Executive Summary

Clever is an offline-first AI assistant built with Flask + SQLite + spaCy, designed as Jordan's personal AI co-pilot for strategic thinking and creative collaboration. The system operates entirely locally to ensure privacy and offline access while providing intelligent natural language processing and contextual memory.

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python Flask web framework
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **NLP Engine**: spaCy for natural language processing
- **Frontend**: HTML5 + JavaScript with Three.js for 3D visualization
- **UI Theme**: Dark futuristic interface with particle system and grid background

### Core Design Principles
- **Offline-First**: No cloud dependencies or network calls
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data remains local
- **Contextual Memory**: Persistent conversation history and learning
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Multiple operational modes (Deep Dive, Quick Hit, Creative, Support)

## System Components

### Backend Services
- Flask web server for API endpoints
- SQLite database for persistent storage
- spaCy NLP pipeline for text analysis
- File ingestion system for document processing

### Frontend Interface
- 3D holographic chamber visualization
- Particle swarm system representing Clever's energy
- Interactive grid that reacts to AI activity
- Frosted glass panels for content display

### Data Flow
