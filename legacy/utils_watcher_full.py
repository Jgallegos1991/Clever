"""Legacy filesystem watcher (archival copy – superseded by active sync logic).

Why:
	Preserved only for historical reference after refactors consolidated multiple
	watcher implementations into the streamlined ``sync_watcher.py`` module. Keeping
	this file (clearly marked legacy) helps future audits understand evolution of the
	sync pipeline and decisions leading to simplification.
Where:
	Not imported by runtime code. Lives under ``legacy/`` and excluded from active
	maintenance except documentation compliance. Any new watcher logic must reside in
	the modern implementation outside the legacy tree.
How:
	Contains no executable logic—intentionally stripped to avoid accidental use while
	still providing narrative context. Safe to delete in a future major version once
	historical reference is no longer valuable.

Connects to:
	- sync_watcher.py: Current canonical watcher implementation.
	- file_ingestor.py / pdf_ingestor.py: Downstream consumers of detected changes.
	- tools/docstring_enforcer.py: Included in coverage to ensure legacy clarity.
