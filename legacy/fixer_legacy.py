"""Legacy fixer utilities (archived).

Why: Preserved for historical reference—shows pre‑refactor approach to code fixing
logic that has since been superseded by `fixer.py` and automated maintenance tools.
Where: Lives under `legacy/` and is not imported by runtime code paths; only relevant
when auditing evolution of the maintenance subsystem or recovering old behavior.
How: Retained as a thin placeholder; original implementation removed to prevent stale
logic from being accidentally executed while still documenting its prior existence.
