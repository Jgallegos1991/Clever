"""Legacy archived version of clever_conversation_engine.

Why: Original file accumulated duplicated method definitions, inconsistent return
structures, and merge artifact text causing syntax errors (E999). It is retained
verbatim (trimmed of runtime side-effects) for future reference during refactor.
Where: Moved under legacy/ to be excluded from linting and imports.
How: Active conversation logic now resides in `persona.py`; this file is inert.

# NOTE: Intentionally not executing any code. Original implementation superseded
# by PersonaEngine. If revived, perform a clean rewrite instead of patching.
