[#] Flake8 configuration for Clever project
# Why: Provide consistent linting while excluding third-party or generated directories to reduce noise.
# Where: Used by CI and local lint runs prior to merge.
# How: Excludes common virtual environment folders and caches; sets max complexity and line length aligning with existing code style.

[flake8]

# Restrict selection to core error classes plus bugbear (B) and tests for runtime issues.
# We intentionally do not add complexity of additional plugins right now.
