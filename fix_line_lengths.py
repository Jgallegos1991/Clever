def fix_app_py():
    """Fix line length issues in app.py.

    Why: The main application file accumulates long f-strings and messages
    during rapid iteration; exceeding style limits reduces readability and
    causes noisy diffs when auto-formatters wrap inconsistently. Centralizing
    surgical replacements keeps history clean and prevents manual line wraps
    drifting across commits.
    Where: Invoked manually or via maintenance scripts when style checks or
    reviewers flag overlength lines in `app.py`â€”isolated to that file to avoid
    unintended global rewrites.
    How: Performs deterministic string replacements and targeted regex-based
    rewrites for specific long literals/f-strings. Does NOT attempt generic
    formatting; intentionally limited scope so changes remain predictable and
    auditable. Writes the modified content back to disk and emits a console
    confirmation.

    Connects to:
        - app.py: Source file whose long lines are normalized
        - CI / code review: Keeps diffs minimal by preemptively enforcing
          consistent wrapping for known problematic strings
