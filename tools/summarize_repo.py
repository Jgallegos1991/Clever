"""Repository summarization utility (currently a lightweight placeholder).

Why:
	Intended foundation for generating high-level repository summaries (file counts,
	key architectural components, recent change hotspots) to assist Clever's persona
	when forming context-aware responses or producing release / audit artifacts. A
	documented stub is preferable to an empty file so the docstring enforcement and
	architectural inventory remain accurate while the feature incubates.
Where:
	Planned to be invoked by future tooling (e.g., an automated release notes
	generator, architecture drift detector, or proactive suggestion engine). By
	placing it under ``tools/`` it remains clearly optional at runtime and excluded
	from performanceâ€‘critical request paths in ``app.py``.
How:
	For now it exposes a single ``summarize()`` function skeleton returning a static
	structure. Future iterations will scan the local workspace (respecting offline
	constraints) using only standard library modules (``pathlib``, ``hashlib``,
	``ast``) to avoid external dependencies.

Connects to:
	- file-inventory.md: Will cross-reference file metadata for richer summaries.
	- evolution_engine.py: Potential future integration to adapt learning focus based
	  on code churn metrics.
	- persona.py: Could supply concise architectural context windows for deep dive
	  explanation requests.

	Why: Provides a stable, documented return contract so downstream experimental
	callers can develop against the shape before full implementation lands.
	Where: Future tooling scripts or persona augmentation hooks.
	How: Counts top-level entries only; deliberately shallow to keep placeholder fast.

	Args:
		root: Filesystem path to repository root (defaults to current directory).

	Returns:
		Dict with coarse metrics (currently only ``top_level_count`` and ``root``).

	Connects to:
		- This module's future expanded logic (planned deeper traversal & AST parsing)
		- persona.py (potential high-level context enrichment)
