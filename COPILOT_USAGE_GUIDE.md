# GitHub Copilot & API Usage Guide

## Purpose
This guide helps you use GitHub Copilot and GitHub API resources efficiently, avoiding rate limits and maximizing productivity.

## Best Practices
- **Authenticate with a Personal Access Token (PAT):**
  - Increases your API rate limit.
  - Store your PAT securely and configure your tools to use it.
- **Monitor API Usage:**
  - Use GitHub's `/rate_limit` endpoint to check your current usage.
  - Consider scripts or tools to alert you when nearing limits.
- **Reduce Unnecessary Requests:**
  - Avoid frequent polling or redundant API calls.
  - Use local caching where possible.
- **Wait for Rate Limit Reset:**
  - If you hit a limit, wait for the reset window (usually 1 hour).
- **Batch Requests:**
  - Group related actions to minimize API calls.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see `API rate limit exceeded`, wait and retry later.
- For persistent issues, review your authentication and request patterns.
